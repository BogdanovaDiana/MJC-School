## Java Collection Tasks

## List
1. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in a array list containing the days of the week (strings).
2. Write a Java program to insert a string "MJC" into the array list at the second and last positions.
3. Write a Java program to copy one array list into another.
4. Write a Java program to reverse elements in a array list.
5. Write a Java program to iterate a linked list in reverse order.
6. Write a Java program to join two linked lists.
7. Write a Java program to remove and return the first element of a linked list.
8. Write a Java program to get the first and last occurrence of the specified elements in a linked list.
9. Write a Java program to add 1 000 000 elements to ArrayList and LinkedList. Measure the time spent. Compare the results.
10. Write a Java program to select an random item from a populated list 100 000 times. Measure the time spent. Compare the results.

## Set
1. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in a hash set.
2. Write a Java program to clone a hash set to another hash set.
3. Write a Java program to convert a hash set to an array.
4. Write a Java program to convert a hash set to a tree set.
5. Write a Java program to compare two sets and retain elements which are same on both sets.
6. Write a Java program to create a new tree set, add all the days of the week (string) and print out the tree set.
7. Write a Java program to create a reverse order view of the elements contained in a given tree set.
8. Write a Java program to find the numbers less than 10 in a given tree set.
9. Write a Java program to get the element in a tree set which is greater than or equal to the given element.
10. Write a Java program to retrieve and remove the last element of a tree set. 

## Queue
1. Write a Java program to create a new priority queue, add all the days of the week (string) and print out the elements of the priority queue.
2. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in priority queue.
3. Write a Java program to add all the elements of a priority queue to another priority queue.
4. Write a Java program to convert a priority queue to an array containing all of the elements of the queue.
5. Write a Java program to convert a Priority Queue elements to a string representation.

## Map
1. Write a Java program to test if a map contains a mapping for the specified key.
2. Write a Java program to test if a map contains a mapping for the specified value.
3. Write a Java program to get a collection view of the values contained in the given map.
4. Write a Java program to get a set view of the keys contained in the given map.
5. Write a Java program to copy a Tree Map content to another Tree Map.
6. Write a Java program to search a key in a Tree Map.
7. Write a Java program to sort keys in Tree Map by using comparator.
8.  *Write a Java program that takes a Map <K, V> as input and returns a Map where the keys and values are swapped.

## Combined
1. Write a Java program that takes an array of String elements as an input and returns Map <String, Integer>, where String is the value from the array and Integer is the number of entries in the array.
2. Write an Iterator over an array.
3. Write a Java program to build a frequency dictionary of the letters of the English alphabet.
